/**
 * An extremely flexible and useful layout, FlowLayout renders similarly to HTML. By default, this layout will lay out all content in a row,
 * breaking into multiple rows when content prefers to be larger. Several options are available:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It can be adjusted to layout content to fill its container, breaking as needed to make the width and height similar, or to lay out in
 * a row, never breaking.</li>
 * <li>It can be made to lay out left-to-right, right-to-left, top-to-bottom, or bottom-to-top</li>
 * <li>In addition individual elements may use the top, left, bottom, right, height, and width attributes to control how they are positioned
 * and sized.</li>
 * <li>If an element should not "get in the way" of other elements being layed out in a container, the included="false" attribute may be
 * specified--the element will then be laid out as if it were the only piece of content in the container and the rest of the content will
 * not be affected by it.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Deleted the (unimplemented) guts of this. Nothing worth saving except the idea and the javadoc.
