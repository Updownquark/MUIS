Implement permissions and a security architecture
	Permission parsing from the Quick registry
	Popup telling the user what permissions an application (with all associated toolkits) requires
Find and close or document Quick vulnerabilities (user code entry points):
	All class initializations
	listeners
	styles (getDomainInstance, getName, iterator)

	constructor
	postInit
	initChildren
	postCreate
	addChild
	removeChild
	isFocusable
	doLayout
	render (draw, drawChildren)
